# 🚲 Bike Sharing System Data Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset. It aims to uncover insights about bike rental patterns, user behavior, and the impact of weather and seasonal conditions using Python.

## 📊 Objectives

- Analyze usage trends across weekdays and months
- Understand the effect of temperature and weather on rental count
- Compare casual vs. registered user activity
- Identify weather patterns in each month
